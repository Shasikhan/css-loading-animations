## Customization

### Colors

The project uses CSS custom properties for easy color customization. Modify the variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #0a0a0a;
  --card-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03);
  --neon-pink: #ff2d75;
  --neon-blue: #0ff;
  --neon-purple: #b300ff;
}
```

### Animation Speed

Each animation's duration can be adjusted by modifying the `animation-duration` property in their respective CSS classes.
